# IT326 - Data Mining Project <br>Students’ Adaptability Level Prediction in Online Education 

## Our Motivation:
We looked for and considered many options while choosing a dataset for this project. We wanted a subject matter that we are familiar with and have or will probably experience. Therefore, we settled on the Students’ Adaptability Level in Online Education dataset. <br>
We hope that by the end of this project, we will have understood what attributes can factor in the effectiveness of the adaptivity level in online education, a process that will most likely be part of the educational system for years and years to come.
